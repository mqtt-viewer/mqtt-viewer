### Start Here

Firstly, thanks for being interested in contributing to MQTT Viewer.

I welcome all contributions, big or small, and I really appreciate the time and effort you put into them.

I'm open to pair programming if you'd like to get a start on a feature or bug fix together or need help setting up your development environment. Just [open a discussion](https://github.com/mqtt-viewer/mqtt-viewer/discussions/new?category=q-a) and let me know.

### Legal

All contributions to this repository are made under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

#### What this means practically

Code inside your PR is automatically licensed under the permissive MIT license. This means that you are granting permission for your code to be used, modified, and distributed by anyone.

As soon as your code is merged into the main branch, it becomes part of the project and is licensed under the same terms as the rest of the project (AGPLv3).

#### Why this is important

By providing your contributions under the MIT license there's no need for [CLAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) or other legal agreements should the license change in the future.
