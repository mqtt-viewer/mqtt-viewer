## Development

MQTT Viewer is built using [Wails](https://wails.io/), a Go-based application framework, and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Wails](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation) (install via `go get github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@2.9.1`)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (install via `npm install -g pnpm`)
- [Just](https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#cross-platform) - optional, but recommended for running commands in the project
- [Atlas](https://github.com/ariga/atlas) - optional, only necessary if you need to create database migrations

### Setup

1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/mqtt-viewer/mqtt-viewer`
2. Navigate to the project directory with `cd mqtt-viewer`
3. Install the Go dependencies with `go mod tidy`
4. Navigate to the frontend directory with `cd frontend`
5. Install the Node.js dependencies with `pnpm install`
6. Navigate back to the root directory with `cd ..`
7. Run the application with `just dev` (or `wails dev` if you don't have Just installed)

If there are problems with Wails, try running `wails doctor` to check your installation.

Please open an issue if you have any problems.

### Hot Reloading

Changes to the frontend code will automatically trigger a rebuild and reload the application quickly.

This may cause some issues if the frontend and backend are now out of sync. If so, just restart the application.

Changes to the Go code will trigger a full rebuild which may take anywhere from a few seconds to a minute depending on your hardware specs.
